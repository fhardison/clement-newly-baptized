# Lemmatization of To the Newly Baptized by Clement of Alexandria

I'd like to thank [Peter Kerby](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/) for kindly allowing me to us his digitization of the text taken from Butterworth's _Clement of Alexandria_.

In this repo you will find the text in the format used by the Greek Learner Texts Project and a lemmatisation of _To the Newly Baptized_ by Clement of Alexandria.

* `text/precents_of_clement.txt` contains the text in the Greek Learner Texts format
* `analysis/tokens.txt` contains the tokenisation

*Note that the title (line `1.0.head` in the text) was not included in the lemmatisation.*

This text is being prepared as part of the [Greek Learner Texts Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org/).
