# Lemmatization of To the Newly Baptized by Clement of Alexandria

I'd like to thank [Peter Kerby](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/) for kindly allowing me to us his digitization of the text taken from Butterworth's _Clement of Alexandria_.

In this repo you will find the text in the format used by the Greek Learner Texts Project and a lemmatisation of _To the Newly Baptized_ by Clement of Alexandria.

This text is being prepared as part of the [Greek Learner Texts Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org/).
