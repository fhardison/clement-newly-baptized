### _To the Newly Baptized_

I'd like to thank [Peter Kerby](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/) for kindly allowing me to us his digitization of the The [Greek text](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-baptized-uni.html) of _To the Newly Baptized_ taken from Butterworth's _Clement of Alexandria_. He cites his source as "Butterworth's Clement of Alexandria, pp. 370-377 in the Loeb Classical Library, first printed 1919".

### _Paschal Homily_

The following Google Books scans of Migne's volume 59 were consulted.
